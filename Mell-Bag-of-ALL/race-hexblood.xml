			<p class="flavor">Where wishing fails, ancient magic can offer a heart’s desire—at least, for a time. Hexbloods are individuals infused with eldritch magic, fey energy, or mysterious witchcraft. Some who enter into bargains with hags gain their deepest wishes but eventually find themselves transformed. </p>
			<h4>Faded Memories</h4>
			<h4>Hexblood Origins</h4>
			<p>A bargain with a hag or other eerie forces transformed your character into a magical being. Roll on or choose an option from the Hexblood Origins table to determine how your character gained their lineage.</p>

			<h4>Hexblood Traits</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different ability scores by 1. If you are replacing your race with this lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with this.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type</em></strong>  You are a Fey.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong>  You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. If you are replacing your race with this lineage, you retain any languages you had and gain no new languages.</p>
		  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.</p>
       <p class="indent"><strong><em>Eerie Token</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can harmlessly remove a lock of your hair, one of your nails, or one of your teeth. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued this way, you can take these actions:</p>
       <p class="indent"><strong><em>Hex Magic</em></strong> You can cast the Disguise Self and Hex spells with this trait. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have.
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose the ability when you gain this lineage).</p>
