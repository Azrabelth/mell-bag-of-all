			<p class="flavor">Death isn’t always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they’ve been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.</p>

			<h4>Hexblood Traits</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Increase one ability score by 2 and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different ability scores by 1. If you are replacing your race with this lineage, replace any Ability Score Increase you previously had with this.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type</em></strong>  You are a Fey.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong>  You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character. If you are replacing your race with this lineage, you retain any languages you had and gain no new languages.</p>
		  <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.</p>
       <p class="indent"><strong><em>Eerie Token</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can harmlessly remove a lock of your hair, one of your nails, or one of your teeth. This token is imbued with magic until you finish a long rest. While the token is imbued this way, you can take these actions:</p>
       <p class="indent"><strong><em>Hex Magic</em></strong> You can cast the Disguise Self and Hex spells with this trait. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have.
Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose the ability when you gain this lineage).</p>
